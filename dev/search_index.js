See below for keyword arguments currently available to control this process.\n\nbox_size: The size of the grid cells (in pixels) used to extract candidate point sources to use for alignment. Defaults to a tenth of the greatest common denominator of the dimensions of img_to. See Photometry.jl > Source Detection Algorithms for more.\nap_radius: The radius of the apertures (in pixel) to place around each point source. Defaults to 60% of first(box_size). See Photometry.jl > Aperture Photometry for more.\nf: The function to compute within each aperture. Defaults to a 2D Gaussian fitted to the aperture center. See the Source characterization section of the accompanying Pluto.jl notebook for more.\nmin_fwhm: The minimum FWHM (in pixels) that an extracted point source must have to be considered as a control point. Defaults to a fifth of the width of the first image. See PSFModels.jl > Fitting data for more.\nnsigma: The number of standard deviations above the estimated background that a source must be to be considered as a control point. Defaults to 1.
